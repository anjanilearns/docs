Welcome to Flare! This guide will walk you through launching the modpack for the first time, understanding the basics, and starting your adventure.

## Launching Flare

1. **Ensure Java is Installed:** Flare, like all Minecraft mods, requires Java to run. If you're unsure if you have it, download and install the latest version from the official website: [https://www.java.com/download/](https://www.java.com/download/).
2. **Open Your Launcher:** If you installed Flare through a launcher like CurseForge or the official launcher, simply select Flare from your modpack list and hit play.
3. **First-Time Setup:** On its first launch, Flare may take a little longer to load as it configures mods. Let it complete this process without interruption.
4. **Adjust Settings (Optional):** Before diving in, you might want to adjust settings like video, audio, and controls in the Options menu.

## Understanding the Basics

Flare aims to enhance the vanilla Minecraft experience. While the core gameplay remains familiar, here are some key things to remember:

* **Performance Mods:** Flare includes mods designed to boost your FPS and improve performance. You can often fine-tune these in the Mod Options menu.
* **Quality of Life Changes:** Expect a smoother, more convenient experience with mods that streamline inventory management, provide helpful information displays, and enhance gameplay.
* **Mod Interactions:** Some mods may introduce new mechanics or alter existing ones. Don't hesitate to consult the in-game guide book (if included) or specific mod pages on this documentation site for more information.

## Starting Your Adventure

Now that you're familiar with the basics, it's time to explore! 

1. **Create a New World:** Select "Singleplayer" from the main menu and create a new world. Flare often comes with custom world generation options, so feel free to experiment!
2. **Explore and Discover:** The world is your oyster. Gather resources, craft tools, and begin your journey to conquer the challenges ahead.
3. **Don't Be Afraid to Experiment:** Flare encourages exploration and experimentation. Try out different mods, tweak settings to your liking, and make the experience your own.
