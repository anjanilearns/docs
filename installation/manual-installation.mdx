This guide outlines the manual installation process for the Flare modpack. This method is recommended for experienced users who prefer direct control over their mod installations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java:** Ensure you have Java installed. Download the latest version from: [https://www.java.com/download/](https://www.java.com/download/).
2. **Minecraft Launcher:** You'll need a working installation of the official Minecraft launcher.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download Flare:** Download the Flare modpack files. You should have a `.zip` or similar archive containing the "mods" folder and other necessary files.
2. **Locate Your Minecraft Directory:** 
   - **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `%appdata%\.minecraft`, and press Enter.
   - **macOS:** Go to `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`.
   - **Linux:** Typically in `~/.minecraft`.
3. **Create a New Profile (Optional):**  In your Minecraft launcher, create a new installation profile for Flare. This helps keep things organized.
4. **Extract Modpack Files:** Extract the contents of the downloaded Flare archive into the root of your chosen Minecraft directory (or within the profile's folder if you created a new one).
5. **Launch the Game:** Select the Flare profile (if created) in your launcher and launch the game.  

## Important Notes

* **Mod Compatibility:**  Manually installing mods can be prone to compatibility issues. Always double-check mod versions and dependencies.
* **Back Up Your Files:** It's highly recommended to back up your Minecraft directory before making any manual changes.
* **Updates:** You'll be responsible for manually updating mods when using this method.

## Troubleshooting

* **Black/Crashed Game:**  Check for incompatible mods or mod conflicts. Refer to the Flare documentation for a compatible mod list.
* **Missing Files:**  Ensure all files were extracted correctly from the downloaded archive.
